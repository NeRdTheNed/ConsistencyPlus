# Consistency+

Consistency+ is a minecraft mod for 1.16.4+ Fabric Mod Loader about making blocks consistent.


## What's added?

Anything that's inconsistent block wise in the game. Such as there being purpur pillars but no stone brick pillars. Or there being cobblestone walls but no quartz walls. These issues and many, many more are fixed in this mod!

NOTE: We went a little overkill with the brainstorming for this mod.  Many of the variants we plan on adding are not things that we seriously would expect mojang to consider adding, but moreso as extra blocks for the builders out there.  While a lot of the variants we plan on adding are things that really should be in vanilla, most are not.


## FAQ

As of 0.1.0, we have substantial additions in Stone, Blackstone, Endstone, Purpur and Quartz, with minor additions in other areas. All of our block additions currently reach almost 110.

### How do you guys add so much?
Many of the blocks we have added so far have been done by hand, but we will be switching to a json generation tool once it is finished, which is mainly developed by Deviouslrd, which is found in another repository. We may change to ARRP or the like.

Well, if you're interested, you can put it as a suggestion in the issue tracker, or even code it in yourself!

Current Planned Additions Count is at 1377, and may raise if we feel like it.

### Will the blocks have CTM support?
There are currently no plans for CTM in the base mod, however we may add this in the future through either updates, addons, or a resource pack.
